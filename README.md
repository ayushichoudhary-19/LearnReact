## Step 3: Components
Components are the building blocks of React applications. They let us split the UI into independent, reusable pieces.

Basically Components in react are JavaScript functions only.
As every function returns something, these components also return markup(piece of HTML code).
```
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}
```

Now, we can use this component within other components also. This concept is called **nested components**
```
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}
```
```
💡 React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.
```

### Questions
* **What is a React component?**
  
React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

* **What are the benefits of using React components?**

There are many benefits to using React components, including:

    * Reusability: Components can be reused throughout an application, which can save time and code duplication.
    * Modularity: Components can be broken down into smaller, more manageable units, which can make code easier to understand and maintain.
    * Testability: Components can be easily tested in isolation, which can help to improve the quality of code.
    * Flexibility: Components can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of an application.

### JSX

The markup syntax we’ve seen above is called JSX. **JSX is stricter than HTML.**
Like in HTML we can place a `<br>` anywhere without a need to close it, in JSX every tag needs a closing. So, You have to close tags like `<br />`. 
Also note that your component also can’t return multiple JSX tags. Each component/function (untill you're used to the term let's also call it a ' JS function'), can return only 1 JSX-tag/markup.

```
function AboutPage() {
  return (

      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hello there.<br />How do you do?</p>

  );
}
```
This is invalid!
However, if you want to return multiple tags, there's a way!
You can simply enclose all the markup in a partent tag. In this way that parent tag will be returned taking all the childs with it.

```
function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hello there.<br />How do you do?</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

or we can wrap them is emply tags also.
```
function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hello there.<br />How do you do?</p>
    </>
  );
}
```


* **What are the different types of React components?**

There are two main types of React components: class components and functional components.

    * Class components are the traditional type of React component. They are defined using classes and have access to lifecycle methods, such as `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`.
    * Functional components are a newer type of React component. They are defined using functions and do not have access to lifecycle methods.

* **How do you create a React component?**

To create a React component, you can use the `React.Component` class or the `React.functionComponent` function.

* **What are the different lifecycle methods of a React component?**

React components have a number of lifecycle methods that are called at different stages in the component's life. These methods include:

    * `componentWillMount`: This method is called before the component is mounted.
    * `componentDidMount`: This method is called after the component is mounted.
    * `componentWillReceiveProps`: This method is called before the component's props are updated.
    * `componentDidUpdate`: This method is called after the component's props are updated.
    * `componentWillUnmount`: This method is called before the component is unmounted.

* **What are props and state in React?**

Props and state are two important concepts in React.

    * Props are the data that is passed to a component from its parent component.
    * State is the data that is managed by a component itself.

* **How do you pass props to a React component?**

To pass props to a React component, you can use the `props` prop.

* **How do you manage state in a React component?**

To manage state in a React component, you can use the `state` property.

* **What are the different ways to render a React component?**

There are two main ways to render a React component:

    * Using the `render` method: The `render` method is a required method in all React components. It is used to return the markup for the component.
    * Using the `JSX` syntax: JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write React components in a more concise and readable way.

* **What are the advantages of using functional components over class components?**

Functional components have a number of advantages over class components, including:

    * They are easier to read and write.
    * They are more performant.
    * They are more testable.

* **What are the disadvantages of using functional components over class components?**

Functional components have a few disadvantages, including:

    * They do not have access to lifecycle methods.
    * They can be more difficult to debug.

* **What are the best practices for writing React components?**

Here are some best practices for writing React components:

    * Keep components small and focused.
    * Use props to pass data to components.
    * Use state to manage data that changes within a component.
    * Use the `render` method to return the markup for a component.
    * Use JSX to write React components in a more concise and readable way.

* **What are some common mistakes to avoid when writing React components?**

Here are some common mistakes to avoid when writing React components:

    * Using global state.
    * Using too many nested components.
    * Not using props correctly.
    * Not using state correctly.
    * Not using the `render` method correctly.
    * Not using JSX correctly.
